    <div class="in">BMI is a measurement of  person's leanness or corpulence based on their height and weight, and is intended to quantify tissue mass. It is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height. Specifically, the value obtained from the calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending on what range the value falls between. These ranges of BMI vary based on factors such as region and age, and are sometimes further divided into subcategories such as severely underweight or very severely obese. Being overweight or underweight can have significant health effects, so while BMI is an imperfect measure of healthy body weight, it is a useful indicator of whether any additional testing or action is required. Refer to the table below to see the different categories based on BMI that are used by the calculator.</div>

    <p align="right">The BMI calculator for children and teenagers is different than the one for adults. While it uses height and weight, it also uses age and gender. That’s because male and female height and weight change during growth and development. For children, BMI is expressed as a percentile as compared to other children of the same age and gender.Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms (or pounds) divided by the square of height in meters (or feet). A high BMI can indicate high body fatness. BMI screens for weight categories that may lead to health problems, but it does not diagnose the body fatness or health of an individual</p>

    <p style="font-size: x-large;">Exercising regularly. This includes cardio and weight-bearing exercises to build muscle and lose fat. This is effective in controlling belly fat. Belly fat increases the risk of certain health conditions. Always talk to your doctor before beginning an exercise program.</p>
    <p style="font-size: x-large;">Being mindful of portion control. Don’t overeat during meals and snacks.</p>

    <h2>Limitations of the BMI</h2>
    <p style="font-size:x-large ;">The BMI calculation does not include muscle mass, which weighs more than fat.
    This means muscular adults and athletes may be classed as overweight or obese even though their body fat is low.
    Bone density. Some people have denser bones and larger frames than others. </p>

                    Children need a certain number of calories to grow and develop. But if a child takes in more calories than he or she uses, the body stores these extra calories as fat. In children who are otherwise healthy, weight gain most often happens because a child takes in more calories than he or she use

                    Choose a diet made of nutrient-rich foods. Nutrient-rich (or nutrient-dense) foods are low in sugar, sodium, starches, and bad fats. They contain a lot of vitamins and minerals and few calories. Your body needs vitamins and minerals, known as micronutrients. They nourish your body and help keep you healthy. They can reduce your risk for chronic diseases. Getting them through food ensures your body can absorb them properly.

                    A good goal for many people is to work up to exercising 5 times a week for 30 to 60 minutes at a time. If 30 to 60 minutes at a time sounds difficult to fit into a busy schedule, you can split up your physical activity into smaller chunks of time. Try exercising for 10 minutes at a time throughout your day. For example, take the stairs instead of the elevator at work. Or go for a walk during your lunch break.
